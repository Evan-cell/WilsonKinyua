I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural GitHub Star star2 based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch React Ladies, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
